HTML5 Audio controller with waveform preview (mixed or split channels), using WordPress native audio shortcode.

## Description ##
This plugin replaces the default WordPress audio player with a player capable of displaying audio waveforms. It can display a mix of the different audio channels (for podcast, radio, e-learning, music), or all channels simultaneously (for sound tutorial, sounds-packs showcases, products demo etc...), which is its main purpose.

By working with the default audio shortcode, you have two great advantages:

*   It works with all your previous posts
*   You still have the default player in the Visual Editor (not just shortcode)
*   It supports every audio format supported by WordPress (wav, ogg, mp3, m4a).
*   Safe deactivation: if you deactivate the plugin, your shortcode will fallback to the WordPress default audio player.

Global colors and style settings can be overridden by dedicated shortcode attributes.

*   `progress_color="purple"`
*   `wave_color="#FF0000"`
*   `cursor_color="#FF0000"`
*   `download_button="true"`
*   `height="128"`

Also, there is two attributes accessible at shortcode level:

*   `mute_button="true"`
*   `loop_button="true"`
